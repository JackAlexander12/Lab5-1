# Lab5-1
Write an application that stores at least five different college courses (such as 
“CSC1302”), the time it first meets in the week (such as “Mon 9 am”), and the instructor 
(such as “Prakash”) in a two-dimensional array. Allow the user to enter a course name 
and display the corresponding time and instructor. If the course exists twice, display 
details for both sessions. If the course does not exist, display an error message "Invalid 
Entry: No Such course". Save the file as TimesAndInstructors.java.
